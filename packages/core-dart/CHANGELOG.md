# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Breaking:** `extractRouting(RoutingInput input)` is now the primary
  **synchronous** function, matching `extractRouting` in TypeScript and
  `ExtractRouting` in Go. Remove `await` at existing call sites.
- Added `extractRoutingAsync(RoutingInput input, {fetchMemoRequirement})`
  for async network checks (SEP-0029 memo requirement). This replaces the
  previous async `extractRouting(..., fetchMemoRequirement: ...)` signature.
- Deprecated `extractRoutingSync`; it now delegates to `extractRouting` and
  will be removed in the next major release. Migrate by renaming
  `extractRoutingSync(input)` to `extractRouting(input)`.

## 1.1.0

- **Flutter Web precision safety for 64-bit routing IDs.**
  - Added `SafeRoutingId`, a BigInt-backed wrapper that parses, validates,
    compares, and serializes MEMO_ID / muxed routing IDs as exact decimal
    strings — never through `int`/JS `Number` — so IDs above
    `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (`2^53 - 1`) up to the uint64 ceiling
    (`2^64 - 1`) are never silently truncated in browser contexts.
  - Added conditional-compilation platform probe: `isWebJsRuntime` is
    `true` only when compiled to JavaScript (Flutter Web / dart2js / DDC).
  - Added web-safe accessors on `RoutingResult`: `idString` (exact canonical
    decimal string) and `safeId` (`SafeRoutingId` wrapper).
  - `SafeRoutingId.fromInt` refuses values above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`
    on web builds instead of propagating an already-truncated JS `Number`.
  - MEMO_ID / MEMO_TEXT uint64 range validation now goes through the
    string-exact `SafeRoutingId` parser (behavior unchanged on all platforms).
  - New Flutter Web test vectors (`test/web_compat/routing_id_web_test.dart`,
    run with `dart test test/web_compat --platform chrome`) covering the
    2^53-1, 2^53, 2^53+1, 2^63-1, 2^63, and 2^64-1 boundary IDs through
    memo extraction, muxed decode, and JSON serialization.
